# Resume Builder

## Overview

Resume Builder is a front-end application that allows users to create and download professional resumes. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is integrated with the [Resume API Backend](https://github.com/osamaaslam86004/Resume-API-Backend.git) to fetch user data and handle resume creation.

## What Needs Improvement

1. **Profile Image Upload:**  
   The application currently does not allow users to upload a profile image for their resume. This limitation exists because the backend [Resume API](https://github.com/osamaaslam86004/Resume-API-Backend.git) does not support image uploads.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Resume Builder, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser. Ensure the backend [Resume API](https://github.com/osamaaslam86004/Resume-API-Backend.git) is running to enable API calls.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osamaaslam86004/Resume-Builder.git
cd Resume-Builder
```
